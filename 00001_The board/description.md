To begin programming, the first element we will use is a squared board, similar to the one that is used to play Chess, Checkers or [Go](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go).
 
These boards can have any size, such as: 

| 4x4 | 3x2 |
|:---:|:---:|
|![4x4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagrado-corazon-alcal/mumuki-fundamentos-gobstones-guia-1-primeros-programas/master/4x4.png)|![3x2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagrado-corazon-alcal/mumuki-fundamentos-gobstones-guia-1-primeros-programas/master/3x2.png)|
 
We will always need a board on which execute our programs, and we will be in charge of creating them for you, in every one of the exercises.
The interesting point is that only one program can be executed on different boards, bringing about different results.
 
> In order for you to check that we don't lie, press “continue” button, and we will generate your first 3x3 board.
