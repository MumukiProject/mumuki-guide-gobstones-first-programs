LetÂ´s understand what we just did: write a program.

Every program has exactly one program: a section of the code which declares the commands (actions) that we want the computer to execute on the initial board. By executing a program, we get a final board.

The syntax of a program is really simple:
1. we write a line which says program, followed by an opening key: {
1. next, the commands: one per line
1. and finally, one last key which closes the one we used before }

Some examples of `program`s:

```gobstones
program {
}
```

(makes nothing)

```gobstones
program {
  Move(North)
}
```

(moves the head one position to the north)

```gobstones
program {
  Move(North)
  Move(North)
}
```

(moves the head two positions to the north)
 
> Knowing this, write a program which, on a 2x4 board with the head in the initial point (the left bottom cell), moves the head three times to the north.
